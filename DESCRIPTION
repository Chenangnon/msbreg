Description: Multistage binomial regression for modelling binomial dependent variables resulting from multistep data generation processes: the success probability of the target event results from many individual stages, each modelled with a separate linear predictor.
    This assumes multiplicative absolute risk between stages, and the common assumption of multiplicative odds (between independent variables) within each stage.
    Bias-reduced estimation based on Jeffreys prior is provided in addition to maximum likelihood estimation. The fitting function also properly handles predictors prone to measurement errors.
